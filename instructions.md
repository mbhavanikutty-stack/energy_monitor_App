# Changes:

1. When the search for options text input field is active it expands all the way, give it some padding to the sides.
2. While in the dark mode, even though I havent selected or hovered over the Category input field it shows the color #3b82f6, its supposed to show the color #e3f2fd.
3. When I hover over the options inside the Category input it should highlight the option that I'm hovering with the background color #3b82f6
4. While in the dark mode the 'search for options' input field and the options of the dropdown are shown as in the light mode making it unreadable, fix this issue so that the texts are readable both in light and dark theme.
5. While in dark mode the navigation bar is white but its supposed to be dark shade with some glossy effects. The glossy effects should be in both the dark and light mode.
6. Remove and move the theme switching button to the navigation bar.
7. Place the theme switching button at the top right corner in the navigation bar.
8. Add a Navigation bar for mobile and desktop which switches automatically depends upon the display size.
